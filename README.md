# Seisberry
Code for Raspberry Pi seismograph, 3 components

## Eager to start? Follow the fast build guide.
This page should get you up and running in 30 to 60 minutes, using an image of the Seisberry, with everything ready.
No need to mess with compiling or running codes if you don't want to. Just connect the parts, set the jumpers and start recording.

## Running on the Raspberry
The python code prefixed Pi_ are optimized to run within the 32 bit memory limits of the Raspberry hardware.
The rest of the code is optimized for 64 bit systems, like a desktop with ample memory.

## C Code
For the C code doing the actual sampling, see:

Read the Jupiter Notebook provided with the project. I spent quite a long time building this documentation, and it should help other users  dramatically cut time and avoid frustration building their own seisberry.
