# Seisberry
Code for Raspberry Pi seismograph, 3 components

## Running on the Raspberry
The python code prefixed Pi_ are optimized to run within the 32 bit memory limits of the Raspberry hardware.
The rest of the code is optimized for 64 bit systems, like a desktop with ample memory.

## C Code
For the C code doing the actual sampling, see:

Read the Jupiter Notebook provided with the project. I spent quite a long time building this documentation, and it should help other users  dramatically cut time and avoid frustration building their own seisberry.
